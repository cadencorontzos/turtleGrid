# turtleGrid
A turtle and a Grid Class in C++

This C++ project uses classes to define a turtle and a grid. The turtle can live inside a grid, and move around inside it. A turtle can rotate left or right, move forward, or turn on it's trail. When its' trail is on, it will mark the grid with X's behind it as it moves around. See the code for more details

The make file makes an executable, try_turtle, which shows the grid and the turtle inside of it when ran, and also takes commands.
